# DebateTabSoftware

## Project Overview
This is a software that takes in debate teams, judges, and rooms and simulates matchups for a debate tournament. The software allows for power pairing (pairing teams with winning records against teams with winnings records) and avoids pairing teams from the same school. 

The software was created as an exploratory experiment for the Charlottesville Debate League.

## Performance
Currently this is about 90% done covering edge-cases. Needs a front end to be implemented, but it still completely usable using command line for input or Java IDE consoles for inputs. 

The software was used in parallel with a paid, professional pairing software and performed with no errors.
